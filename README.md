You can type this simple and clear message:

**"Hi Abtin, Iâ€™ve shared the prototype slides here. These include exploratory UI/UX suggestions and layout improvements. Please feel free to review and let me know if you'd like any refinements."** 

Let me know if you want a version that sounds even more casual or formal.

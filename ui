Slide Title: Proposed Changes – Signatory Section

Bullet Points:

Refined Button Design: Replaced flat rectangular buttons with rounded, shadowed styles to improve clarity and call-to-action visibility (e.g., “Save” and “Continue”).

Aligned Form Fields: Standardized spacing and alignment for each input group to reduce visual strain and guide user flow more effectively.
